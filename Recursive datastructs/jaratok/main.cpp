**Problem Summary:**

A cave system is constructed with regular rooms and connecting tunnels between them. The system is drawn on a plane, and rooms are accessed through tunnels. The deepest room is the only one at the lowest level, and each room can be accessed from at most two tunnels leading from the room directly below. The tunnels have a uniform length and are inclined at a 45-degree angle either to the left or to the right.

Write a program that determines how many rooms can be directly accessed by drilling vertically from the surface downwards, and which rooms these are.

**Input:**

- The first line of the standard input contains the number of rooms (1 ≤ N ≤ 1000) and the number of tunnels (0 ≤ M ≤ 2000).
- The subsequent N-1 lines describe the tunnels leading upwards. Each line contains the indices of the two endpoints of the tunnel (1 ≤ Ai < Fi ≤ N), specifying the lower and upper endpoints respectively. It also specifies whether the upper endpoint is to the left (B) or to the right (J).

**Output:**

- The first line of the standard output should contain the number of rooms that can be directly accessed by drilling vertically from the surface downwards.
- The second line should list the indices of these rooms in any order.

**Example:**

**Input:**
```
10 9
1 J 2
1 B 3
3 B 6
3 J 5
2 J 4
5 B 7
5 J 8
7 J 10
7 B 9
```

**Output:**
```
5
9 7 10 8 4
```

/*
The provided program solves the problem of determining how many rooms can be directly accessed by drilling vertically from the surface downwards in a cave system. It also lists the indices of these rooms. Here's a breakdown of the approach and the implementation:

### Approach:

1. **Graph Representation:**
   - The program represents the cave system as a directed graph, where each room is a node, and the tunnels are directed edges. The edges also indicate the direction of inclination of the tunnels.

2. **Traversal and Room Selection:**
   - The program starts from the surface room and traverses the tunnels downward.
   - It identifies the rooms that can be directly accessed by drilling vertically.

3. **Output:**
   - The program outputs the number of rooms that can be directly accessed and the indices of these rooms.

### Implementation:

1. **Graph Representation:**
   - The program uses arrays to represent the graph, where the index represents the position in the vertical direction (from top to bottom) and the value represents the room index.

2. **Traversal and Room Selection:**
   - The program traverses the tunnels and calculates the positions of the rooms based on the tunnel directions.
   - It identifies the rooms that can be directly accessed by drilling vertically.

3. **Output:**
   - The program outputs the number of rooms that can be directly accessed and the indices of these rooms in ascending order.

### Example Walkthrough:

Let's go through the given example step by step to determine the rooms that can be directly accessed by drilling vertically.

### Input:
```
10 9
1 J 2
1 B 3
3 B 6
3 J 5
2 J 4
5 B 7
5 J 8
7 J 10
7 B 9
```

### Steps:
1. **Graph Representation:**
   - The program uses arrays to represent the graph, where the index represents the position in the vertical direction and the value represents the room index.

2. **Traversal and Room Selection:**
   - The program traverses the tunnels and calculates the positions of the rooms based on the tunnel directions.
   - It identifies the rooms that can be directly accessed by drilling vertically.

3. **Output:**
   - The program outputs the number of rooms that can be directly accessed and the indices of these rooms.

### Conclusion:

The program effectively calculates the rooms that can be directly accessed by drilling vertically from the surface downwards in the given cave system, satisfying the problem's requirements.
