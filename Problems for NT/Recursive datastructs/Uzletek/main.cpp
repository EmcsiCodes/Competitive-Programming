**Problem Summary:**

A distribution company transports magazines via trains to various railway junctions. Magazines are printed centrally and transported accordingly. At railway junctions, they are transferred to trains heading in the appropriate directions, and this process incurs a usage fee for each route. The goal is to maximize profit by strategically placing stores at specific junctions.

Write a program to calculate the maximum achievable profit and determine which junctions to open stores in.

**Input:**

- The first line of input contains the number of junctions (N) and the serial numbers of two junctions, A and B.
- The next line contains N integers, representing the potential profit achievable at each junction.
- Following are N-1 lines, each containing two serial numbers I and J, signifying a route from junction J to junction I and the usage fee.

**Output:**

- Print the maximum achievable profit on the first line.
- On the second line, output M, the number of junctions to open stores in.
- On the third line, provide the serial numbers of these junctions.

**Example:**

**Input:**
```
10 2
100 100 50 50 50 100 200 100 50 50
1 2 200
3 4 10
4 5 10
4 2 100
2 6 10
6 7 100
6 8 150
8 9 30
10 8 60
```

**Output:**
```
320
6
2 3 4 5 6 7
```

The provided program addresses the problem of maximizing profit for a distribution company by strategically placing stores at specific railway junctions. The goal is to determine the maximum achievable profit and the junctions to open stores in to maximize this profit.

Here's a breakdown of the approach and the implementation:

### Approach:

1. **Graph Representation:**
   - The program represents the railway junctions and their routes as a graph, where each node represents a junction, and edges represent routes between junctions.

2. **Profit Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the profit achievable at each junction based on the given potential profits and the usage fee of routes.

3. **Store Placement:**
   - The program places stores at certain junctions to maximize the profit while considering the usage fee of routes and the achievable profits.

4. **Output:**
   - The program outputs the maximum achievable profit, the number of junctions to open stores in, and the serial numbers of these junctions.

### Implementation:

1. **Graph Representation:**
   - The program uses an adjacency list to represent the graph, where each junction stores its routes and associated usage fees.

2. **Profit Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the profit achievable at each junction by considering the potential profits and adjusting based on the usage fee of routes.

3. **Store Placement:**
   - The program decides where to open stores to maximize profit, considering the usage fee and profit at each junction. It tracks the visited junctions and places stores accordingly.

4. **Output:**
   - The program outputs the maximum achievable profit, the number of junctions to open stores in, and the serial numbers of these junctions.

### Example Walkthrough:

Let's go through the given example step by step, showing how the program calculates the maximum achievable profit and the junctions to open stores in.

### Input:
```
10 2
100 100 50 50 50 100 200 100 50 50
1 2 200
3 4 10
4 5 10
4 2 100
2 6 10
6 7 100
6 8 150
8 9 30
10 8 60
```

### Steps:
1. **Profit Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the potential profits achievable at each junction and adjusts them based on the usage fee of routes.

2. **Store Placement:**
   - The program decides where to open stores to maximize profit, considering the usage fee and profit at each junction.

3. **Output:**
   - The program outputs the maximum achievable profit, the number of junctions to open stores in, and the serial numbers of these junctions.

### Conclusion:

The program effectively calculates the maximum achievable profit and determines the junctions to open stores in to maximize this profit based on the given setup.
